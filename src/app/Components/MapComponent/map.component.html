          Sri Lanka (/sriː ˈlɑːŋkə, -ˈlæŋkə/ or Listeni/ʃriː-/;[8][9] Sinhalese: ශ්‍රී ලංකා Śrī Laṃkā, Tamil: இலங்கை Ilaṅkai), officially the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, is an island country in South Asia near south-east India. Sri Lanka has maritime borders with India to the northwest and the Maldives to the southwest.

          Sri Lanka's documented history spans 3,000 years, with evidence of pre-historic human settlements dating back to at least 125,000 years.[10] Its geographic location and deep harbours made it of great strategic importance from the time of the ancient Silk Road[11] through to World War II.[12] Sri Lanka was known from the beginning of British colonial rule until 1972 as Ceylon (/sᵻˈlɒn, seɪ-, siː-/). Sri Lanka's recent history has been marred by a thirty-year civil war which decisively ended when the Sri Lankan military defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009.[13]

          A diverse and multicultural country, Sri Lanka is home to many religions, ethnic groups, and languages.[14] In addition to the majority Sinhalese, it is home to large groups of Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils, Moors, Burghers, Malays, Kaffirs and the aboriginal Vedda.[15] Sri Lanka has a rich Buddhist heritage, and the first known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka, the Pāli Canon, date back to the Fourth Buddhist council in 29 BC.[16][17]
